## Development

- Written in TypeScript
- Don't update _react-native-svg_ to `12.3.0` - breaks web animation for circle as mentioned [here](https://github.com/marcuzgabriel/reanimated-animation-library/pull/3) - previous version works fine => `"react-native-svg": "12.2.0"`,

## Future plans:

- Localization
- Notification when Timer runs out
- Light / Dark theme
