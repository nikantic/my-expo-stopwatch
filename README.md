# Stopwatch & Timer app (React Native Expo)


Proof of concept Stopwatch & Timer app built with React Native and Expo.

Important notice:

- Don't update *react-native-svg* to `12.3.0` - breaks web animation for circle as mentioned [here](https://github.com/marcuzgabriel/reanimated-animation-library/pull/3) - previous version works fine - **"react-native-svg": "12.2.0"**,

Future:

- Localization and single labels file
- Notification when Timer runs out
- Light / Dark theme
