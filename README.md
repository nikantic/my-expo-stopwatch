# My Expo Stopwatch

...

- Dont update react native svg to 12.3.0 - breaks web animation for circle: https://github.com/marcuzgabriel/reanimated-animation-library/pull/3
- this version works fine - "react-native-svg": "12.2.0",

To do:

- Change Count to Reanimated (miliseconds)
- Stopwatch: SavedTimes screen (Flatlist)
- Navigation
- Deploy app
- Test on iOS and Android simulators

To fix:

- [Android] - Stopwatch full circle bug
- Stopwatch makes no sense without miliseconds
- Limit clock to the width of device
- Web styling fixes
- Different Colors for stopwatch and timer
- Check Stopwatch Count function logic again

Future:

- Localization and single labels file
